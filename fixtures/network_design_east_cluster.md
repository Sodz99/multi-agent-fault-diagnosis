# East Cluster Network Design Document

## Document Information
- **Document ID**: NET-DESIGN-EAST-001
- **Version**: 2.1
- **Last Updated**: 2024-05-15
- **Author**: Network Engineering Team
- **Approval**: Chief Network Architect

## Executive Summary

The East Cluster serves as a critical region supporting 45,000+ subscribers across 12 cell sites. The cluster implements a centralized MME architecture with redundant backhaul connectivity to ensure 99.9% availability targets.

## Network Architecture

### RAN Layer
- **Technology**: LTE-Advanced (Category 6)
- **Frequency Bands**: Band 2 (1900MHz), Band 4 (AWS), Band 12 (700MHz)
- **Cell Sites**: 12 macro sites with 3-sector configuration
- **Coverage**: 85 kmÂ² suburban/urban mixed environment
- **Capacity Planning**: 3,750 users per site peak busy hour

### Core Network Integration
- **MME Cluster**: MME-CLSTR-3 (Active/Standby pair)
- **SGW Pool**: Shared with West Cluster for load balancing
- **HSS**: Centralized subscriber database
- **PCRF**: Policy control and charging rules

### Backhaul Network
- **Primary Links**: Fiber optic 1Gbps per site
- **Backup Links**: Microwave 100Mbps for sites 9-12
- **Transport Protocol**: MPLS-TE with traffic engineering
- **QoS Classes**: 4 service classes (Voice, Video, Data, Signaling)

## Critical Dependencies

### Sector 12A Specifics
Sector 12A (Cell ID: 501234012) serves the highest traffic density in the cluster:
- **Peak Hour Traffic**: 800 Mbps downlink, 250 Mbps uplink
- **Subscriber Load**: 400+ active users during peak
- **Handover Relations**: 8 neighbor cells (intra + inter-frequency)
- **Backhaul Requirement**: Minimum 1Gbps, burst to 1.2Gbps

### Known Constraints
1. **Transport Bottleneck**: TL-E3-001 link shared between 12A and 12B
2. **Interference Issues**: Band 2 suffers from DTV broadcasting interference
3. **Capacity Limitation**: MME-CLSTR-3 approaching 80% utilization
4. **Geographic Challenge**: Site 12A in valley creates coverage holes

## Fault Diagnosis Procedures

### KPI Thresholds
- **Call Drop Rate**: >2% triggers investigation
- **Packet Loss**: >0.5% indicates transport issues
- **PRB Utilization**: >90% requires load balancing
- **RRC Success Rate**: <95% suggests configuration problem

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Level 1**: Automated remediation (load balancing, power adjustments)
2. **Level 2**: NOC engineer intervention within 15 minutes
3. **Level 3**: Field technician dispatch for hardware issues
4. **Level 4**: Vendor support escalation for software bugs

### Common Failure Patterns
- **Transport Congestion**: Usually affects sites 12A, 12B due to shared link
- **MME Overload**: Cascades to all 12 sites in cluster
- **Weather Impact**: Microwave links 9-12 vulnerable to precipitation
- **DTV Interference**: Band 2 performance degradation during evening hours

## Remediation Strategies

### Immediate Actions
1. Load balancing to neighbor cells
2. Admission control parameter adjustment
3. QoS policy modification for non-critical traffic
4. Transport link prioritization

### Preventive Measures
1. Proactive capacity monitoring with 2-week trending
2. Weekly interference scans on all frequency bands
3. Monthly transport link utilization reports
4. Quarterly MME performance optimization
