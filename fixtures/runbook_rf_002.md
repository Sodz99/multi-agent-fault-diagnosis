# RF Congestion Mitigation Checklist

1. Validate traffic probe data for the impacted sector.
2. Compare RRC connection attempts vs. success over the last 15 minutes.
3. Inspect neighboring cells for overlapping maintenance or anomalies.
4. Rebalance carriers if congestion persists longer than 10 minutes.
5. Escalate to core team when throughput drop exceeds 25%.
